            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I'm a game development programmer with a focus on Unity (C#) and Unreal Engine (C++ & Blueprints).
                During my time at
                Full Sail University, I not only built the technical foundation required for game development but also
                gained experience
                collaborating with diverse, multi-disciplinary teams.
            </p>
            <p>
                Along this journey, I’ve worked on two complete game projects—both of which are featured below—and each
                one taught me
                something new about design, teamwork, and what it means to bring an idea to life.
            </p>
            <p>
                I’m passionate about crafting fantastical games that are both immersive and enjoyable for players of all
                kinds.

                    <p>UI/UX Engineer<br>
                        A first-person zombie shooter created in Unity as a midterm project. I was responsible for
                        designing and implementing
                        all menus and HUD elements, with a strong focus on functionality and intuitive layout. Despite
                        challenges during our
                        two-month development window, this project was a valuable first experience in team-based game
                        development.

                        A farming simulation game with combat elements, built in Unity as my capstone project. I'm
                        responsible for designing and
                        programming the entire UI/UX experience, including the HUD, menus, and a fully functional
                        inventory system developed
                        during the second month of the project.
