    <p>
    The Death Knight Corporation is my personal brand.
      When my games are released, they will be released under this name.
      Once I can afford an artist, I will post the channel banner, logo, etc. here.
    </p>

    <div style="color: white;">
      Below are the games I am working on.<br>
      As of writing this, they are using default assets while I create the systems.<br>
      Once I have the assets, I will upload pictures of the game.<br>
      If you click on the game section, <br>
      it will take to where I discuss the game's development in more detail.
