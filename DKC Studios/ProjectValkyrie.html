        <section class="SectTitle">This game is heavily inspired by the game Trails of Cold Steel most
            importantly the first game in the series.

            <br>
            The game is planned to have a similar structure to the adventure as Trails of Cold Steel 1, but with less
            focus on bond activities and a larger focus on team building and composition. The inspiration for the
            combat system is Final Fantasy X's CTB system where you can periodically interact with the environment or
            enemy parts to alter how combat plays out.
