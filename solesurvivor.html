            <p>UI/UX Engineer<br>
                A first-person zombie shooter created in Unity as a midterm project. I was responsible for
                designing and implementing
                all menus and HUD elements, with a strong focus on functionality and intuitive layout. Despite
                challenges during our
                two-month development window, this project was a valuable first experience in team-based game
                development.
