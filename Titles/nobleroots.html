            <p>UI/UX Engineer<br>
                A farming simulation game with combat elements, built in Unity as my capstone project. I'm
                responsible for designing and
                programming the entire UI/UX experience, including the HUD, menus, and a fully functional
                inventory system developed
                during the second month of the project.
