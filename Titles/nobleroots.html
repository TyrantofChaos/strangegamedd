            <p>Noble Roots was expected to be a farming/life simulation game with a focus on automating the farming
                process; developed using <b>Unity engine and C# programming</b>. You would start as a disgraced noble,
                and left with nothing but a small farm and be required
                to build your reputation with the townsfolk. Reputation would be tracked by a point system that
                incremented as you participated in several activities such as farming, communicating with the
                town-folk, and completing town quests. This game was a trial in what to do with failure. Every
                member of our team had issues with all different systems. I learned a lot working with <b>Inventory
                systems</b> and creating <b>functional UIs</b> during this project, and given the time, I probably
                could make
                these systems work as intended.

                My position for the game was <b>UI/UX Engineer</b> where my focus was to properly display informative
                elements of the game to the player, and the <b>systems programmer</b> with a primary focus on
                inventory systems and inventory management systems. During the first month of the game, I designed
                the base UI elements.

            The <b>Health system</b> was fully functional but never implemented fully due to our gameplay programmer
            was not
            able to finish the combat system. However, we were able to finish implementing the <b>stamina system</b>, for
            testing
             purposes, the Player Character had a lot more than we planned to use; but we did get values working
            and changing based on the different actions the player takes. Tilling, Planting, and Watering crops all
             take stamina, and the meter will slowly drain. We intended for the player to pass out and wake up in
             their bed the next day if they ran out of stamina. However, we never solved the problem of saving the game
            which was necessary to stop the field from deleting its contents. Saving the game was one of the biggest
            issues during the last two months we were working on the game.

                Turns out clocks are easy to make our sound designer finished it for me while I was designing the
                <b>inventory UI</b>. Unfortunately, since saving does not work the number for the day of the month
                increments but does not change anything but the number. Day 1 and 2... might as well be the same.
                Originally we wanted to use an analog clock, but none of us were certain how we would set it
                up so we kept the digital clock over an analog one.

                This, and the <b>inventory management system</b>, was my baby. Did it work? Haha, no. This is the one thing
                I wanted to work on when starting the project. We all knew the inventory systems were going to be one
                of the more challenging tasks early in development. After developing the system for two months, I
                could see why systems like this usually have a team. Since the gameplay programmer already had the
                items categorized in a database and managed internally, I thought I would just need to display it.
                That would work if the player did not want to manage the inventory through the UI.

                Above, I show that the inventory does recognize items that the player picks up. It is supposed to go
                to the hotbar first which was the first problem. I thought we could just implement the management
                system and I will fix it after. I am not winning points with this system.<br>
                <b>I got clicking on the item to select it working.</b><br>
                <b>I got dragging the item data working.</b><br>
                I never figured out how to drop the item data in a new slot.
