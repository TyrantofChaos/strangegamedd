                Sole Survivor is a first-person zombie survival game where the player needs to repair a vehicle to
                exit the stage. We were a team of five members that held our meetings after class. The project had 2
                months of development or 8 weeks. Most teams focused on making first-person shooter games as it was
                how our professor/producer taught us. We decided to make our game distinct with our escape design.

                My job during the two-month development was UI/UX engineering, Menu Design, and Level
                Selection/Transitions. I created the main menu, options menu, and level selection. The HUD for the
                player's information was also mine. I connected the image of the HealthBar to a player Health
                component and used the player health component to determine the fill of the image. Transitions were
                required by the producer despite the game loading fast enough you don't see them.
