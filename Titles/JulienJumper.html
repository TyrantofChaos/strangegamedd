            <div style="color: white">Julien Jumper was one of the hardest projects I had to work on during my school
                term. We were required to use the <b>Direct X 11/12 or Vulkan APK</b> to create a playable experience
                and
                our answer unlike any other member of our class was a 2d vertical platformer. Everyone in my group
            did our previous project in Direct X 11 leaving me the only member with any Vulkan experience.</div>

        <section>
            <div style="color: white">This was the first of two projects that I took the Director role for. At the
            time my understanding of Direct X 11 and other APKs was too weak to keep up with the powerhouses I was
            given. So I was given the Director position and Team Lead position since I was the only member with
            enough time to work around everyone's hectic schedules. I remember many late nights and early
            mornings discussing with Liam and Kevin about where we were with the project. Liam had become our
            FLECS master, Unfortunately we never needed to use it for our project and were given the OK by the
            producers to not use it.</div>

            <div style="color: white">The chaos of that first meeting where we began joking with each other until
                someone brought up the movie "Madagascar" and that cemented the idea of our main character being a
            lemur named Julien. We decided on a platformer, despite our producers warning about the difficulty
                with collision checking. We really should have taken those few extra minutes as our <b>collision</b>
                system was finished minutes before our final week. On the bright side that knowledge of working on
            collision systems for 3 weeks came in handy when I had three members of this group during the
                production of <a href="MegaDude.html">Megadude</a>.</div>

            <div style="color: white">Keeping up with a team where two members are only available in the evening
                and one who was only available at night did add some difficulty in relaying everyones progress. I
                set up branches in the <b>Git Repo</b> so everyone was able to work effectively. Whenever an issue
                arose that was when the Tyrant of Chaos would come to assist in <b>brainstorming, code review,</B> or
                when
                necessary <b>debug</B> it myself. This was the month were I had to learn <b>BASH</B> we had some moments
                where
                you could swear that Git itself was working against us. Between staring at merge conflicts almost
                every day and that one day when I manually parsed all of our code base before giving up and using
                Bash to overwrite the debugging branch.
