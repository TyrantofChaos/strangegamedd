                MegaDude's Development cycle was exactly 4 weeks or 28 days to be exact. We were not given anymore
                time than that to create a game loop with Unreal Engine 5 with a start and end state. There were five
                members of the team, and we all helped in different ways. My job as <b>Team Lead</b> was making <b>progress reports</b> to the producers,
                <b class="programBold">GitBash/Github</b> (we had not been shown how to use perforce yet), <b>Jira
            </b> tickets, <b>reviewing pull requests</b>, and <b class="programBold">debugging errors</b>.
