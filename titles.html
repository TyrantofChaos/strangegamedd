                <p>UI/UX Engineer<br>
                    A first-person zombie shooter created in Unity as a midterm project. I was responsible for
                    designing and implementing
                    all menus and HUD elements, with a strong focus on functionality and intuitive layout. Despite
                    challenges during our
                    two-month development window, this project was a valuable first experience in team-based game
                    development.

                <p>UI/UX Engineer<br>
                    A farming simulation game with combat elements, built in Unity as my capstone project. I'm
                    responsible for designing and
                    programming the entire UI/UX experience, including the HUD, menus, and a fully functional
                    inventory system developed
                    during the second month of the project.
