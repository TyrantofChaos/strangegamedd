        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
        I'm a game development programmer with a focus on Unity (C#) and Unreal Engine (C++ & Blueprints).
        During my time at
        Full Sail University, I not only built the technical foundation required for game development but also
        gained experience
        collaborating with diverse, multi-disciplinary teams.
        </p>
        <p>
        Along this journey, I’ve worked on two complete game projects—both of which are featured below—and each
        one taught me
        something new about design, teamwork, and what it means to bring an idea to life.
        </p>
        <p>
        I’m passionate about crafting fantastical games that are both immersive and enjoyable for players of all
        kinds.
