        <p>
        Hello, you have found Douglas Strange's Portfolio site. I program everything on this site using <b class="programBold">HTML</b>, <b class="programBold">CSS</b>, and <b class="programBold">JavaScript</b>. I spend most of my time in game development — a multidisciplinary programming field that blends <b>technical systems</b>, <b>design logic</b>, and <b>creative problem-solving</b>. My specialties include <b class="programBold">Unreal Engine 5</b>, <b class="programBold">Unity</b>, and <b class="programBold">Game Maker</b>, along with <b class="programBold">C++</b>, <b class="programBold">C#</b>, and <b class="programBold">GML</b>, respectively. In my spare time, I’m currently learning <b class="programBold">Python</b>, as well as the spoken languages <b class="languageBold">German</b> and <b class="languageBold">Japanese</b>.
        </p>

        <p>
        I am the Solo Developer of the below projects:
        <ul>
            <li>"<b>Project Valkyrie</b>" an Unreal Engine 5, RPG inspired by the
                classic Legend of Heroes franchise</li>
            <li>"<b>Project Blue</b>" a Unity Engine, tactical RPG inspired by Fire Emblem and the
                Disgaea series</li>
            <li>"<b>Project Green</b>" an RPG Maker Engine, smaller scale turn-based RPG than the previous two
                games with a larger focus on learning design skills.</li>
        </ul>

        <br>
        <p>
        My favorite games are "Trails of Cold Steel" (the whole series), "Devil May Cry 5," and "Honkai Star Rail" as they
            have great stories and fun gameplay. I love anime from "Ketekyo Hitman Reborn" and "Bleach" to "The Apothecary
            Diaries" and "Dan Da Dan." I also love CCGs like "Shadowverse" and "Cardfight Vanguard" for the ability to create
            game plans and execute them.
